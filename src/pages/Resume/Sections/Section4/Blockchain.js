        With 4 years of hands-on experience in the blockchain space, I’ve
        explored the ecosystem from the inside out—engaging with trading,
        swapping, and navigating everything from Bitcoin fundamentals to the
        architecture of Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols. My journey has taken me
        through the dynamic worlds of DeFi, NFTs, staking, and decentralized
        applications (dApps), giving me a solid grasp of how these systems
        function, evolve, and connect.

        This isn’t just theory—I’ve actively participated in the crypto space,
        gaining practical insight into how users interact with decentralized
        exchanges (DEXs), smart contracts, and token economies. My experience
        has shaped a sharp intuition for user flow, accessibility, and trust—key
        elements when designing in such a high-stakes, high-speed environment.
        Crypto is evolving fast, but UX is lagging behind—and I see an
        opportunity to close that gap through clear, user-centered design.

        Looking ahead, I’m exploring the world of blockchain-focused front-end
        development—slowly getting hands-on with tools like Web3.js. While I’m
        not fully shifting yet, I’m laying the groundwork to eventually merge my
        design expertise with the evolving needs of decentralized technology.
